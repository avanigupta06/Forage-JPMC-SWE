#  JPMorgan Chase Software Engineering Job Simulation on Forage

The JPMorgan Chase Software Engineering Job Simulation on Forage is a free virtual experience program designed to give students a hands-on feel for what it's like to work as a software engineer at JPMorgan Chase. It typically includes real-world tasks modeled after the kind of work you'd do at the company

## üß© Problem Statement
You're a software engineer at JPMorgan Chase & Co. Your team is working on a trading platform that provides clients with real-time stock prices.

The current application is broken, and your job is to:

Understand the existing codebase.

Fix issues that prevent the application from displaying data correctly.

Establish a connection to a data feed server that streams live stock prices.

Visualize and update stock prices in the frontend dynamically.

Enhance the functionality of the trading interface (e.g., highlight changes in stock prices in real-time).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Simulated Workflow
You clone a GitHub repo containing a React.js front-end and a Python-based price data feed simulator.

You run both front-end and back-end locally.

You:

Fix bugs in the front-end so that it correctly displays price data.

Ensure that the app subscribes to the WebSocket server.

Parse and display real-time stock prices for two companies.

Highlight price changes dynamically (green for up, red for down).

## üéØ Final Outcome
By the end of the simulation, the app should:

Receive and display live stock price updates

React visually to price changes (with color cues)

Be debugged and cleaned up for production
